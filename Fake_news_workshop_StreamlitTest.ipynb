        "There have always been fake news, but with the emergence of the Internet and new communication and information technologies, fake news has become part of our daily lives on the net. Social media algorithms do not have it easy to determine the truthfulness of information. In this way, supposedly real images and videos that have been professionally manipulated are disseminated. This disinformation can influence debates and public opinion\n",
        "\n",
        "A clear recent example of the impact that fake news has had on people was the case of Donald Trump’s election. Several media outlets claim that one of the main reasons Donald Trump won the election was because he abused the posting of fake news on several of his social networks. This meant that, thanks to the disinformation, Donald Trump won a greater number of votes than the other candidates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, very few people are able to detect fake news or have time to verify if the information they are reading is real or false. This should not be a problem for people, because thanks to artificial intelligence we will be able to detect whether it is a fake or a real news.\n",

        "We as humans are very biased. In everyday life, we make many assumptions that turn out to be wrong. For example, when something bad happened, we have a \"hindsight bias\", i.e. we think that we expected this to happen, even though we actually didn't. Or the loss-aversion bias. If an item has a certain value, then we weight loosing it higher than gaining it. There are many more biases, and Wikipedia has a very exhaustive list, [if you're interested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) . We may be born with some of these biases, but others are usually acquired when we grow up.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, Machine Learning algorithms can also acquire biases when they grow up, i.e. when we train them on a problem. If you want your algorithm to classify diseases, but only provide images of a certain sub-population, it will assume that everyone falls into that population. For example, if you train it on images of men, it'll assume that there are only men in this world. If you then show it a picture of a woman, it'll make a wrong decision. This can have very bad consequences. In the worst case, your algorithm discriminates against a certain ethnicity, and suddenly you make headlines as the inventor of a racist AI. Important to note is that the algorithm itself has no tendency to be biased. But if we provide it with a biased dataset, it will eventually become biased, because it doesn't know better.\n",

        "Essencially there's a couple ways to deal with the problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data-level techniques — At the data level, solutions work by applying resampling techniques to balance the dataset. These can be done by oversampling the minority class, which is to synthetically create new instances from existing ones; or undersampling the majority class, which eliminates some instances in the majority class. However, both techniques can have their drawbacks. Oversampling new data can cause the classifier to overfit; whereas undersampling can discard essential information. A combination of both techniques with a heuristic approach can be found in specialized literature with excellent results.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Algorithmic-level techniques —Algorithmic level solutions can be done by adjusting weighted costs accordingly to the number of training instances in each class. In parametric classifier like Support Vector Machine, grid search and cross-validation can be applied to optimise the C and gamma values. For non-parametric classifier like the decision tree, adjusting the probabilistic estimate at the tree leaf can improve the performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A combination of both — A hybrid approach is also constantly being explored in various literature, including AdaOUBoost (adaptive over-sampling and undersampling boost) proposed by Peng and Yao and Learning By Recognition, using the concept of auto association-based classification approach proposed by Japkowicz.\n",
        "\n",

But they are almost always impossible to verify.\\n\\nNevertheless, it is true that Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, causing speculation about his health. But the gossip mill started up again last week when Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since Sept. 3, when he attended a concert with his wife. It went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the “Great Successor,” as he is known, was in an “indisposed condition.”\\n\\n“Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people,” said the narrator of a documentary called “Improving the Lives of the People,” showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month. It aired just before the session of the assembly, North Korea’s quasi-parliament, was broadcast, the Daily NK Web site reported.\\n\\nWith Kim shown carting around heavy things, the narrator continued: “His whole body is drenched in sweat, but he does not stop working hard, instead showing concern for the health of the other workers.”\\n\\nSeparately, the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the Workers’ Party, recently reported that Kim had “labored on,” visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather.\\n\\nOutside commentators have guessed that Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.\\n\\nWeibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China’s official papers, ran a commentary Monday titled “For those who make up rumors of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?”\\n\\n“Netizens who have a radical opinion can’t represent the opinion of China and China’s attitude toward North Korea was not changed,” the paper said.\\n\\nIn Washington, U.S. officials said they had no information about North Korea’s leader. “I can just say that I have no confirmation of the reports,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters. “We’ve seen them, but we don’t have any confirmation.”\\n\\nIn Beijing, a U.S. diplomat said Monday that North Korea has rejected U.S. efforts to discuss the detention of three Americans, Reuters reported. Glyn Davies, U.S. special representative for North Korean policy, who is visiting the region, said Pyongyang’s refusal to discuss the issue was a sign that it “doesn’t have an interest in coming back into the international system as a responsible country.”</td>\n",

But they are almost always impossible to verify.\\n\\nNevertheless, it is true that Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, causing speculation about his health. But the gossip mill started up again last week when Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since Sept. 3, when he attended a concert with his wife. It went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the “Great Successor,” as he is known, was in an “indisposed condition.”\\n\\n“Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people,” said the narrator of a documentary called “Improving the Lives of the People,” showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month. It aired just before the session of the assembly, North Korea’s quasi-parliament, was broadcast, the Daily NK Web site reported.\\n\\nWith Kim shown carting around heavy things, the narrator continued: “His whole body is drenched in sweat, but he does not stop working hard, instead showing concern for the health of the other workers.”\\n\\nSeparately, the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the Workers’ Party, recently reported that Kim had “labored on,” visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather.\\n\\nOutside commentators have guessed that Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.\\n\\nWeibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China’s official papers, ran a commentary Monday titled “For those who make up rumors of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?”\\n\\n“Netizens who have a radical opinion can’t represent the opinion of China and China’s attitude toward North Korea was not changed,” the paper said.\\n\\nIn Washington, U.S. officials said they had no information about North Korea’s leader. “I can just say that I have no confirmation of the reports,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters. “We’ve seen them, but we don’t have any confirmation.”\\n\\nIn Beijing, a U.S. diplomat said Monday that North Korea has rejected U.S. efforts to discuss the detention of three Americans, Reuters reported. Glyn Davies, U.S. special representative for North Korean policy, who is visiting the region, said Pyongyang’s refusal to discuss the issue was a sign that it “doesn’t have an interest in coming back into the international system as a responsible country.”</td>\n",

        "\n",
        "The idea of stemming is to reduce different forms of word usage into its root word. For example, “drive”, “drove”, “driving”, “driven”, “driver” are derivatives of the word “drive” and very often researchers want to remove this variability from their corpus. Compared to lemmatization, stemming is certainly the less complicated method but it often does not produce a dictionary-specific morphological root of the word. In other words, stemming the word “pies” will often produce a root of “pi” whereas lemmatization will find the morphological root of “pie”.\n",

              "      <td>TOKYO — Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader who has mysteriously been missing from the public eye for almost a month, sparking rumors covering every possibility from a stroke to a coup d’etat, is merely recovering from ankle surgery, a South Korean newspaper has reported.\\n\\nKim had fractured both of his ankles and had surgery in Pyongyang in the middle of September to treat them, the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper, reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source.\\n\\n“I heard that Kim Jong Un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,” the source was quoted as saying, adding that he had the operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.\\n\\nSuch is the fascination with North Korea, the world’s most impenetrable country, that rumors spread like wildfire. But they are almost always impossible to verify.\\n\\nNevertheless, it is true that Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, causing speculation about his health. But the gossip mill started up again last week when Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since Sept. 3, when he attended a concert with his wife. It went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the “Great Successor,” as he is known, was in an “indisposed condition.”\\n\\n“Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people,” said the narrator of a documentary called “Improving the Lives of the People,” showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month. It aired just before the session of the assembly, North Korea’s quasi-parliament, was broadcast, the Daily NK Web site reported.\\n\\nWith Kim shown carting around heavy things, the narrator continued: “His whole body is drenched in sweat, but he does not stop working hard, instead showing concern for the health of the other workers.”\\n\\nSeparately, the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the Workers’ Party, recently reported that Kim had “labored on,” visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather.\\n\\nOutside commentators have guessed that Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.\\n\\nWeibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China’s official papers, ran a commentary Monday titled “For those who make up rumors of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?”\\n\\n“Netizens who have a radical opinion can’t represent the opinion of China and China’s attitude toward North Korea was not changed,” the paper said.\\n\\nIn Washington, U.S. officials said they had no information about North Korea’s leader. “I can just say that I have no confirmation of the reports,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters. “We’ve seen them, but we don’t have any confirmation.”\\n\\nIn Beijing, a U.S. diplomat said Monday that North Korea has rejected U.S. efforts to discuss the detention of three Americans, Reuters reported. Glyn Davies, U.S. special representative for North Korean policy, who is visiting the region, said Pyongyang’s refusal to discuss the issue was a sign that it “doesn’t have an interest in coming back into the international system as a responsible country.”</td>\n",

But the gossip mill started up again last week when Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since Sept. 3, when he attended a concert with his wife.

Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.\\n\\nWeibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations.

              "      <td>TOKYO — Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader who has mysteriously been missing from the public eye for almost a month, sparking rumors covering every possibility from a stroke to a coup d’etat, is merely recovering from ankle surgery, a South Korean newspaper has reported.\\n\\nKim had fractured both of his ankles and had surgery in Pyongyang in the middle of September to treat them, the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper, reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source.\\n\\n“I heard that Kim Jong Un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,” the source was quoted as saying, adding that he had the operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.\\n\\nSuch is the fascination with North Korea, the world’s most impenetrable country, that rumors spread like wildfire. But they are almost always impossible to verify.\\n\\nNevertheless, it is true that Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, causing speculation about his health. But the gossip mill started up again last week when Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since Sept. 3, when he attended a concert with his wife. It went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the “Great Successor,” as he is known, was in an “indisposed condition.”\\n\\n“Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people,” said the narrator of a documentary called “Improving the Lives of the People,” showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month. It aired just before the session of the assembly, North Korea’s quasi-parliament, was broadcast, the Daily NK Web site reported.\\n\\nWith Kim shown carting around heavy things, the narrator continued: “His whole body is drenched in sweat, but he does not stop working hard, instead showing concern for the health of the other workers.”\\n\\nSeparately, the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the Workers’ Party, recently reported that Kim had “labored on,” visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather.\\n\\nOutside commentators have guessed that Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.\\n\\nWeibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China’s official papers, ran a commentary Monday titled “For those who make up rumors of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?”\\n\\n“Netizens who have a radical opinion can’t represent the opinion of China and China’s attitude toward North Korea was not changed,” the paper said.\\n\\nIn Washington, U.S. officials said they had no information about North Korea’s leader. “I can just say that I have no confirmation of the reports,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters. “We’ve seen them, but we don’t have any confirmation.”\\n\\nIn Beijing, a U.S. diplomat said Monday that North Korea has rejected U.S. efforts to discuss the detention of three Americans, Reuters reported. Glyn Davies, U.S. special representative for North Korean policy, who is visiting the region, said Pyongyang’s refusal to discuss the issue was a sign that it “doesn’t have an interest in coming back into the international system as a responsible country.”</td>\n",

              "      <td>TOKYO — Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader who has mysteriously been missing from the public eye for almost a month, sparking rumors covering every possibility from a stroke to a coup d’etat, is merely recovering from ankle surgery, a South Korean newspaper has reported.\\n\\nKim had fractured both of his ankles and had surgery in Pyongyang in the middle of September to treat them, the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s largest newspaper, reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source.\\n\\n“I heard that Kim Jong Un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,” the source was quoted as saying, adding that he had the operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.\\n\\nSuch is the fascination with North Korea, the world’s most impenetrable country, that rumors spread like wildfire. But they are almost always impossible to verify.\\n\\nNevertheless, it is true that Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, causing speculation about his health. But the gossip mill started up again last week when Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since Sept. 3, when he attended a concert with his wife. It went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the “Great Successor,” as he is known, was in an “indisposed condition.”\\n\\n“Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people,” said the narrator of a documentary called “Improving the Lives of the People,” showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month. It aired just before the session of the assembly, North Korea’s quasi-parliament, was broadcast, the Daily NK Web site reported.\\n\\nWith Kim shown carting around heavy things, the narrator continued: “His whole body is drenched in sweat, but he does not stop working hard, instead showing concern for the health of the other workers.”\\n\\nSeparately, the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the Workers’ Party, recently reported that Kim had “labored on,” visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather.\\n\\nOutside commentators have guessed that Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.\\n\\nWeibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China’s official papers, ran a commentary Monday titled “For those who make up rumors of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?”\\n\\n“Netizens who have a radical opinion can’t represent the opinion of China and China’s attitude toward North Korea was not changed,” the paper said.\\n\\nIn Washington, U.S. officials said they had no information about North Korea’s leader. “I can just say that I have no confirmation of the reports,” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters. “We’ve seen them, but we don’t have any confirmation.”\\n\\nIn Beijing, a U.S. diplomat said Monday that North Korea has rejected U.S. efforts to discuss the detention of three Americans, Reuters reported. Glyn Davies, U.S. special representative for North Korean policy, who is visiting the region, said Pyongyang’s refusal to discuss the issue was a sign that it “doesn’t have an interest in coming back into the international system as a responsible country.”</td>\n",

        "*The* problem with training a machine learning algorithm is that it will eventually start to focus too much on special features of our dataset. At some point, it would make almost zero errors on this data, but it would be highly overtrained on the problem and not understand that other problems might require a slightly different approach. It is similar to giving a human the exact same dataset each time, asking them to make a guess, and telling them the correct answer. If we do this many many times, the person may start memorising the correct answer for each picture, but does not actually know the reason why a certain image is categorised as it is. This problem is called **overfitting** and it's something we need to prevent when we train a model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of this situation, we want to teach our algorithm (or our model) to recognise the featurest. Ideally, we want to develop/train a model that can be brought to production and make good predictions on new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "A very simple solution is to give the network less time to fix errors it makes on the training set.  This is called **early stopping**. With this approach, it would still be able to make **general** predictions and do quite well on new, previously unseen data.   \n",
        "\n",
        "To assess how well our network generalises, we need to split our dataset into different parts. We have the the **training set**, that we provide the features and the labels. Then we have a **test set**, where we test the model of an unseen test-set without labels and compare the results with the actual labels giving us the accuracy of the model over unseen data. \n",
