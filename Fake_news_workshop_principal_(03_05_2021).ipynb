Social media algorithms do not have an easy task determining the truthfulness of information. In this way, supposedly real images and videos that have been professionally manipulated are disseminated. This disinformation can influence debates and public opinion and cause a hugh damage on our society and daily lifes.\n",
        "\n",
        "A clear recent example of the impact that fake news had on people was the case of Donald Trump’s election or Brexit. Several media outlets claim that one of the main reasons Donald Trump won the election was because he abused the posting of fake news on several of his social networks. \n",

        "Unfortunately, very few people are able to detect fake news or have time to verify if the information they are reading is real or false. This should not be a problem for people, because thanks to artificial intelligence we will be able to detect whether it is a fake or a real news.\n",

A helpful first step towards identifying fake news is to understand what other news organizations are saying about the topic. We believe automating this process, called Stance Detection, could serve as a useful building block in an AI-assisted fact-checking pipeline.

        "We as humans are very biased. In everyday life, we make many assumptions that turn out to be wrong. For example, when something bad happened, we have a \"hindsight bias\", i.e. we think that we expected this to happen, even though we actually didn't. Or the loss-aversion bias. If an item has a certain value, then we weight loosing it higher than gaining it. There are many more biases, and Wikipedia has a very exhaustive list, [if you're interested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) . We may be born with some of these biases, but others are usually acquired when we grow up.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, Machine Learning algorithms can also acquire biases when they grow up, i.e. when we train them on a problem. If you want your algorithm to classify diseases, but only provide images of a certain sub-population, it will assume that everyone falls into that population. For example, if you train it on images of men, it'll assume that there are only men in this world. If you then show it a picture of a woman, it'll make a wrong decision. This can have very bad consequences. In the worst case, your algorithm discriminates against a certain ethnicity, and suddenly you make headlines as the inventor of a racist AI. Important to note is that the algorithm itself has no tendency to be biased. But if we provide it with a biased dataset, it will eventually become biased, because it doesn't know better.\n",
        "\n",

        "Essencially there's a couple ways to deal with the problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data-level techniques — At the data level, solutions work by applying resampling techniques to balance the dataset. These can be done by oversampling the minority class, which is to synthetically create new instances from existing ones; or undersampling the majority class, which eliminates some instances in the majority class. However, both techniques can have their drawbacks. Oversampling new data can cause the classifier to overfit; whereas undersampling can discard essential information. A combination of both techniques with a heuristic approach can be found in specialized literature with excellent results.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Algorithmic-level techniques —Algorithmic level solutions can be done by adjusting weighted costs accordingly to the number of training instances in each class. In parametric classifier like Support Vector Machine, grid search and cross-validation can be applied to optimise the C and gamma values. For non-parametric classifier like the decision tree, adjusting the probabilistic estimate at the tree leaf can improve the performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A combination of both — A hybrid approach is also constantly being explored in various literature, including AdaOUBoost (adaptive over-sampling and undersampling boost) proposed by Peng and Yao and Learning By Recognition, using the concept of auto association-based classification approach proposed by Japkowicz.\n",

        "\n",
        "The idea of stemming is to reduce different forms of word usage into its root word. For example, “drive”, “drove”, “driving”, “driven”, “driver” are derivatives of the word “drive” and very often researchers want to remove this variability from their corpus. Compared to lemmatization, stemming is certainly the less complicated method but it often does not produce a dictionary-specific morphological root of the word. In other words, stemming the word “pies” will often produce a root of “pi” whereas lemmatization will find the morphological root of “pie”.\n",

        "*The* problem with training a machine learning algorithm is that it will eventually start to focus too much on special features of our dataset. At some point, it would make almost zero errors on this data, but it would be highly overtrained on the problem and not understand that other problems might require a slightly different approach. It is similar to giving a human the exact same dataset each time, asking them to make a guess, and telling them the correct answer. If we do this many many times, the person may start memorising the correct answer for each picture, but does not actually know the reason why a certain image is categorised as it is. This problem is called **overfitting** and it's something we need to prevent when we train a model.\n",

        "A very simple solution is to give the network less time to fix errors it makes on the training set.  This is called **early stopping**. With this approach, it would still be able to make **general** predictions and do quite well on new, previously unseen data.   \n",
        "\n",
        "To assess how well our network generalises, we need to split our dataset into different parts. We have the the **training set**, that we provide the features and the labels. Then we have a **test set**, where we test the model of an unseen test-set without labels and compare the results with the actual labels giving us the accuracy of the model over unseen data. \n",

        "In contrast to model parameters which are learned during training, model hyperparameters are set by the data scientist ahead of training and control implementation aspects of the model, these hyperparameters can be thought of as model settings. These settings need to be tuned for each problem because the best model hyperparameters for one particular dataset will not be the best across all datasets. The hyperparameter optimization is the process of hyperparameter tuning, where we find the combination of hyperparameter values for a machine learning model (in this case the GBM) that performs the best - as measured on a validation dataset - for a problem.\n",

Random and Grid Search are two uniformed methods for hyperparameter tuning and Scikit Learn offers these functions through GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV. Below we will see how to apply both models.\n",

This method has a single parameter k which refers to the number of partitions the given data sample is to be split into. So, they are often called k-fold cross-validation. The data is divided into training, validating and testing set to prevent data leaks. So the testing set should only be transformed after model is fit using the train and validation set. Each time the model fits the train data they are evaluate with the test data and the average of evaluation score is used to analyze the overall model.\n",

        "After training and selecting the best model, the last step is converting our python script into a webapp or an application so that users can use it without the manipulation of codes and in a friendly user interface. Flask python-driven web application is a good choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "The advantage of web applications is that they’re platform independent and can be run by anyone who has access to the Internet. Their code is implemented on a back-end server, where the program processes incoming requests and responds through a shared protocol that’s understood by all browsers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python powers many large web applications and is a common choice as a back-end language. Many Python-driven web applications are planned from the start as web applications and are built using Python web frameworks such as Flask.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python-driven web applications use Python code to determine what actions to take and what content to show. Your code is run by the web server that hosts your website, which means that your users don’t need to install anything. All they need to interact with your code is a browser and an Internet connection. Getting Python to run on a website can be complicated, but there are a number of different web frameworks that automatically take care of the details.\n",
